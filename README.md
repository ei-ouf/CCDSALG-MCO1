## ✅ Implemented Algorithms

- [x] Insertion Sort
- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Merge Sort
- [ ] ✅ Custom Algorithm (To be decided)

Each sorting algorithm sorts an array of `Record` objects in ascending order based on the ID number. The name associated with each ID remains intact post-sorting.

## 📊 Project Goals

- Implement and test multiple sorting algorithms.
- Measure execution time and frequency of steps.
- Benchmark each algorithm on multiple datasets.
- Analyze algorithm efficiency with empirical data.
